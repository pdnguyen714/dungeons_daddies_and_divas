## Problems We're Solving:
* D&D Players want to find other players
* D&D Players are lonely and looking for love
* D&D Players don't have a good place to meet each other

## Advantages 
* A dedicated space just for DnD players to fully express themselves maximizes their potential for making a meaningful connection
* The world can always use more nerdery and love, as long as there's enough server space to support it. 

## Solution

* Users are able to create posts to communicate with other users
* There will be post categories (i.e. "Connection Wanted", "Party Links") where users can find the information they want. 
* It's everything you could want in quarantine-land. 

## Product

## Thoughts on Future Development
