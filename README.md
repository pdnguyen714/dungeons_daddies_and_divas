## Problems We're Solving:
* DnD Players want to find other players
* DnD Players are lonely and looking for love
* DnD Players don't have a good place to meet each other

## Advantages 
* A dedicated space just for DnD players to fully express themselves maximizes their potential for making a meaningful connection
* The world can always use more nerdery and love, as long as there's enough server space to support it. 

## Solution
* Users have the ability to create a profile page for other users to find them
* Users are able to create posts to communicate with other users
* There will be post categories (i.e. "Connection Wanted", "Party Links") where users can find the information they want. 
* It's everything you could want in quarantine-land. 

## Product
* Forum Page: Users can navigate between posts and make, edit, and delete their own comments. 

## Thoughts on Future Development
* Profile Page: Users can fill out profile information to provoke other users' ~~thirst~~ interest
* Chat Functionality
* Post Categories and Sorting
